* Arduino Powerswitch
Documentation and implementation of a power switch controlled by an arduino

** The Idea
Any regular powerswitch has to be controlled by hand.
I wanted to make one that can be controlled programmatically so I started this project.

Note: When I started this, I knew next to nothing about electronics.
I got most of the information from advice I got from an electronics store owner.

** Requirements
*** Required Software
    - Dia (only if you want to make the diagrams, the svg files are included in this repository)
    - Arduino SDK (to upload the programs to your arduino)
*** Required Materials
    - An arduino (Arduino one)
    - A resistor (10K)
    - A transistor (MOSFET BS170)
    - A relay
    - A diode (1N4007)
    - A powerstrip
    - Soldering materials
